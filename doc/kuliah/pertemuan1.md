Meet 1 Kapita Selekta
=====================

Github is one of the sites sharing our project. There is many developer to use Github. Github also have many benefit because too many project are **open source.**

To contribute in github we must have an account. 

**The effective project is one repository for one project**

There are a basic command to input our local files to github. And we should have a software to send our local project. The software is **Git Bash**, you can download it from **https://git-scm.com/**

> Here is a basic command line and function if we use git bash or another software like that :

> - Git init = function to initiate on our local folder to the github repository that we have set previously.
> - Git status = to know if there is a change or is there something we have to edit on our local file.
> - Git add = if there is then we can use the command git add to add it if we want to put it in github (still dalah replenishment process but have not yet entered fully into github repository that we created).
> - Git commit -m "your coment here" = this command can we URLs that we've agreed to increase or change the files that we have done.
> - Git push origin master = command is what we do as a final project untu displacement of local to github.
> - Git pull origin master = command is done if we work on a joint project team. Because we are working on a similar project on a different computer in order to maintain the sustainability of the project that was done with this team. This command is arguably often used as a team because we can add files at the same repository albeit in a different computer.
